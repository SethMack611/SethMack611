**👋 Hi there! I’m Seth Austin Mack**

I’m a Senior Software Engineering major at Morehouse College (Class of 2026), passionate about systems programming, game development, and reproducible science. Over the past few years, I’ve:

* 🎮 Designed and prototyped *Legends of Aetheris*, a Black-centric RPG using GameMaker
* 🤖 Co-developed **Frostbyte**, an AI-powered assistant for science gateways, and laid the groundwork for an AI coding assistant tailored to game dev
* 🚀 Participated in the 2023 SGX3 Virtual Coding Institute  + 2025 Hackathon
* 🏆 Led and mentored teams at hackathons, Boy Scouts events, and the ADMI Conference

I’m fluent in C++ and Python. I love open-source: you’ll find my work on multimedia chat apps and reproducibility scorecards here.

Outside of code, I’m building a community around inclusive game development. My ultimate goal is to launch my own Black-centered RPG studio. Let’s connect!
